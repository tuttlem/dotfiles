# Sublime Text Configs

This folder contains all of the settings that I use for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). 

## Installation

To apply these settings files do your installation of sublime text, you just need to copy them to your preferences folder:

```
$ cd dotfiles/sublime-text-3
$ cp *.sublime-settings ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User
```
